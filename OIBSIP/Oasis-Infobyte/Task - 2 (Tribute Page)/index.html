              Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore Bengali: রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941) was a Bengali polymath who worked as
              a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and music
              as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly
              sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to
              win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant
              prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred
              to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.

              A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an
              eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun
              Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short
              stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of
              nationalism, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal
              Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two
              thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.

              The name Tagore is the anglicised transliteration of Thakur. The original surname of the Tagores was Kushari. They
              were Pirali Brahmin ('Pirali’ historically carried a stigmatized and pejorative connotation) originally belonged
              to a village named Kush in the district named Burdwan in West Bengal. The biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, Prabhat
              Kumar Mukhopadhyaya wrote in the first volume of his book Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshak that. The Kusharis
              were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of Bhatta Narayana; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in
              Burdwan zilla) by Maharaja Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as Kushari.

            <h3><b>Early life: 1861–1878</b></h3>
            <p>
              The youngest of 13 surviving children, Tagore (nicknamed "Rabi") was born on 7 May 1861 in the Jorasanko mansion in
              Calcutta, the son of Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–1875).

              elbow turned outward with a shawl draped over his shoulders and in Bengali formal wear. In front of him, the woman,
              seated, is in elaborate dress and shawl; she leans against a carved table supporting a vase and flowing leaves.
              Tagore and his wife Mrinalini Devi, 1883
              Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely.
              The Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the publication of literary magazines;
              theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several
              professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and teach Indian classical music to the children. Tagore's
              oldest brother Dwijendranath was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed
              to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician,
              composer, and playwright. His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari Devi,
              slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884, soon after he married,
              left him profoundly distraught for years.

            <h3><b>Shelaidaha: 1878–1901</b></h3>
            <p>
              Because Debendranath wanted his son to become a barrister, Tagore enrolled at a public school in Brighton, East Sussex,
              England in 1878. He stayed for several months at a house that the Tagore family owned near Brighton and Hove, in
              Medina Villas; in 1877 his nephew and niece—Suren and Indira Devi, the children of Tagore's brother Satyendranath—were
              sent together with their mother, Tagore's sister-in-law, to live with him. He briefly read law at University College
              London, but again left school, opting instead for independent study of Shakespeare's plays Coriolanus, and Antony and
              Cleopatra and the Religio Medici of Thomas Browne. Lively English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes impressed Tagore,
              whose own tradition of Nidhubabu-authored kirtans and tappas and Brahmo hymnody was subdued. In 1880 he returned
              to Bengal degree-less, resolving to reconcile European novelty with Brahmo traditions, taking the best from each.
              After returning to Bengal, Tagore regularly published poems, stories, and novels. These had a profound impact within
              Bengal itself but received little national attention. In 1883 he married 10-year-old Mrinalini Devi, born
              Bhabatarini, 1873–1902 (this was a common practice at the time). They had five children, two of whom died in
              childhood.

            <h3><b>Santiniketan: 1901–1932</b></h3>
            <p>
              In 1901 Tagore moved to Santiniketan to found an ashram with a marble-floored prayer hall—The Mandir—an experimental
              school, groves of trees, gardens, a library. There his wife and two of his children died. His father died in 1905.
              He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income from the Maharaja of Tripura, sales of his family's
              jewellery, his seaside bungalow in Puri, and a derisory 2,000 rupees in book royalties. He gained Bengali and
              foreign readers alike; he published Naivedya (1901) and Kheya (1906) and translated poems into free verse.

            <p>
              In 1912, Tagore translated his 1910 work Gitanjali into English. While on a trip to London, he shared these poems with
              admirers including William Butler Yeats and Ezra Pound. London's India Society published the work in a limited edition,
              and the American magazine Poetry published a selection from Gitanjali. In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won
              that year's Nobel Prize in Literature: the Swedish Academy appreciated the idealistic—and for Westerners—accessible
              nature of a small body of his translated material focused on the 1912 Gitanjali: Song Offerings. He was awarded a
              knighthood by King George V in the 1915 Birthday Honours, but Tagore renounced it after the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh
              massacre. Renouncing the knighthood, Tagore wrote in a letter addressed to Lord Chelmsford, the then British Viceroy
              of India, "The disproportionate severity of the punishments inflicted upon the unfortunate people and the methods of
              carrying them out, we are convinced, are without parallel in the history of civilised governments...The time has come
              when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation, and I for my part wish to
              stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of my country men."

            <p>
              In 1919, he was invited by the president and chairman of Anjuman-e-Islamia, Syed Abdul Majid to visit Sylhet for the
              first time. The event attracted over 5000 people.
              In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist Leonard Elmhirst set up the "Institute for Rural Reconstruction", later
              renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of Welfare", in Surul, a village near the ashram. With it, Tagore sought to moderate
              Gandhi's Swaraj protests, which he occasionally blamed for British India's perceived mental – and thus ultimately
              colonial – decline. He sought aid from donors, officials, and scholars worldwide to "free village from the
              shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalis[ing] knowledge". In the early 1930s he targeted ambient
              "abnormal caste consciousness" and untouchability. He lectured against these, he penned Dalit heroes for his poems and
              his dramas, and he campaigned—successfully—to open Guruvayoor Temple to Dalits.
